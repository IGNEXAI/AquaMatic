# Compliance Reporting Workflow Plan

This document outlines the plan for building an automated compliance reporting workflow using Python and Inngest. The workflow will process water quality data, generate a PDF report, and email it to stakeholders.

## Workflow Steps

The workflow will be composed of the following steps, orchestrated by Inngest:

1.  **Trigger:** The workflow will be triggered by an event, such as `api/report.generate`. This event will carry the water quality data as its payload.

2.  **Data Validation:** The first step in the workflow will be to validate the incoming water quality data. This function will ensure that the data is in the correct format and contains all the necessary information.

3.  **PDF Generation:** Once the data is validated, a function will be called to generate a PDF report. This function will use a library like `FPDF` or `WeasyPrint` to create the PDF.

4.  **Email Notification:** After the PDF is generated, a function will be called to send an email with the PDF report attached. This function will use a service like SendGrid or AWS SES to send the email.

5.  **Error Handling:** The workflow will include error handling to gracefully manage failures at any step. If a step fails, a notification will be sent to an administrator, and the workflow will be marked as failed.

## Inngest Implementation

The workflow will be implemented using the Inngest Python SDK. Each step in the workflow will be an Inngest function.

-   **`on_report_generate(ctx, step)`:** This will be the main workflow function, triggered by the `api/report.generate` event.
-   **`validate_data(ctx, step)`:** A step within the workflow to validate the data.
-   **`generate_pdf(ctx, step)`:** A step to generate the PDF.
-   **`send_email(ctx, step)`:** A step to send the email.

This modular approach will allow for easy testing and maintenance of the workflow.
